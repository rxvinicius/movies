# React Prime

React native movies app inspired in Prime Video.

## Prerequisites
* Install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) on a physical device
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) 12 LTS (or greater) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) installed

## Getting Started

* Clone this repository
* Access the project directory
* Override baseURL value in [Api.js](src/services/Api.js) by your ip
* Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
* `yarn start` to start a development server from the terminal

Once the development server is running, the easiest way to launch the app is on a physical device with Expo Go. For more information, see [Open app on a device](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/#open-the-app-on-your-device).
