## Prerequisites

- Install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) on a physical device
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) 12 LTS (or greater) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) installed

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository
- Access the project directory
- Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- `yarn start` to start a development server from the terminal

## Running locally

- Clone this [repository](https://github.com/rxvinicius/movies-api)
- Follow the step by step
- Override `baseURL.dev` value by your ip in [constants.js](src/shared/constants.js) and pass `dev` value to [Api.js](src/services/Api.js)

Once the development server is running, the easiest way to launch the app is on a physical device with Expo Go. For more information, see [Open app on a device](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/#open-the-app-on-your-device).
